# ALEX-smooth
Smoother of a radial data vector.


This program takes a .CSV file, extract all the data there, that are theoretically radial data and other things not so interesting, and smooth then with equally spaciated values to be used later on. Simple program, simple usage in linux:
```octave
ALEX-smooth "file name"
```
and you will obtain another file with the smoothed data. In other operative systems, just run the script within the Octave console.

Remember that you need to have in the same folder the file "display-rounded-matrix.m".
And that's all...
